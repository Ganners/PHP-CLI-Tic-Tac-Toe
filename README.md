PHP CLI Tic Tac Toe Game
------------------------

This is a very OO implementation of a game of Tic Tac Toe which can be played
on the command line, developed in PHP for a 24 hour challenge. It allows
players to play eachother, or to play against a bot, or even a bot to play
against another bot.

The AI is currently buggy and doesn't act totally defensively, it's a similar
implementation to that of MiniMax, which it may evolve to be.

As this is still a prototype, it wasn't developed using tests. Tests will
be added shortly as I do plan to fix the bugs with the AI, test out new
implementations and refactor the code-base.

To launch the game simply run '$ /usr/bin/php tic_tac_toe.php', or use php-cli!

This was developed by Mark Gannaway as an experiment for using PHP for I/O 
command line applications. It turns out to be pretty easy!
